By the end of this course, you will develop a greater understanding of network architecture, operations, intrusion tactics, common types of network vulnerabilities and attacks, and how to secure networks. You’ll also be introduced to common network protocols, firewalls, virtual private networks (VPNs), and system hardening practices. 

## Course 3 content
Each course of this certificate program is broken into weeks. You can complete courses at your own pace, but the weekly breakdowns are designed to help you finish the entire Google Cybersecurity Certificate in about six months.

What’s to come? Here’s a quick overview of the skills you’ll learn in each week of this course.

### Week 1: Network architecture
Five icons show the course followed by the four weeks sequentially from left to right with week 1 highlighted.
You'll be introduced to network security and explain how it relates to ongoing security threats and vulnerabilities. You will learn about network architecture and mechanisms to secure a network.
