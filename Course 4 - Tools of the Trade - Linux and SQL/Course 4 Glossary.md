# Terms and definitions from Course 4

## A
**Absolute file path:** The full file path, which starts from the root
**Application:** A program that performs a specific task. Applications send requests to the operating system, and the operating system directs those requests to the hardware. The hardware also sends information back to the operating system, and the operating system sends it back to applications.
**Argument (Linux):** Specific information needed by a command
**Authentication:** The process of verifying who someone is
**Authorization:** The concept of granting access to specific resources in a system

## B
**Bash:** The default shell in most Linux distributions
**Basic Input/Output System (BIOS):** A microchip that contains loading instructions for the computer and is prevalent in older systems
**Bootloader:** A software program that boots the operating system

## C
**CentOS:** An open-source distribution that is closely related to Red Hat
**Central Processing Unit (CPU):** A computer’s main processor, which is used to perform general computing tasks on a computer
**Command:** An instruction telling the computer to do something
**Command-line interface (CLI):** A text-based user interface that uses commands to interact with the computer. A CLI allows users to enter commands that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
**Computer operating system:** The job of a computer operating system is to help make other computer programs run efficiently. It does this by managing the details related to controlling computer hardware.

## D
**Database:** An organized collection of information or data
**Date and time data:** Data representing a date and/or time
**Digital forensics:** The practice of collecting and analyzing data to determine what has happened after an attack. Digital forensic tools in KALI LINUX such as tcpdump is a command-line packet analyzer which is used to capture network traffic. Another tool commonly used in the security profession is Wireshark. It has a graphical user interface that can be used to analyze live and captured network traffic. And as a final example, Autopsy is a forensic tool used to analyze hard drives and smartphones. 
**Directory:** A file that organizes where other files are stored
**Distributions (also called distros or flavors of Linux.):** The different versions of Linux. The pre-installed programs, user interfaces, and parent distributions might differ from one Linux distribution to another.
**Parent Distributions:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux (CentOS), Slackware (SUSE), Debian (Ubuntu and KALI LINUX)

## E
**Exclusive operator:** An operator that does not include the value of comparison

## F
**File path:** The location of a file or directory
**Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS):** The component of the Linux OS that organizes data. An easy way for you to think about the FHS is to think about it as a filing cabinet of data. The FHS is how data is stored in a system. It's a way to organize data so that it can be found when the data is accessed by the system.
**Filtering:** Selecting data that match a certain condition
**Foreign key:** A column in a table that is a primary key in another table

## G
**Graphical user interface (GUI):** A user interface that uses icons on the screen to manage different tasks on the computer. Basic GUI components include Start menu, Task bar, Desktop with icons and shortcuts

## H
**Hard drive:** A hardware component used for long-term memory

**Hardware:** The physical components of a computer

## I
**Inclusive operator:** An operator that includes the value of comparison
**Internal hardware:** The components required to run the computer

## K
**Kali Linux TM:** An open-source distribution of Linux that is widely used in the security industry. It is a Debian-derived distribution, it contains many pre-installed tools for cybersecurity tasks, and it should be used on a virtual machine.
**Kernel:** The component of the Linux OS that manages processes and memory. The kernel communicates with the hardware to execute the commands sent by the shell. The kernel uses drivers to enable applications to execute tasks. 

## L
**Legacy operating system:** An operating system that is outdated but still being used
**Linux:** An open-source operating system. Components of Linux include User, Applications, Shell, Filesystem Hirarchy Standard, Kernel, Hardware
**Log:** A record of events that occur within an organization's systems

## M

**Memory Management:** The OS handles resource and memory management to ensure the limited capacity of the computer system is used where it is needed most.

## N
**nano:** A command-line file editor that is available by default in many Linux distributions
**Numeric data:** Data consisting of numbers

## O
**Operating system (OS):** The interface between computer hardware and the user
**Operator:** A symbol or keyword that represents an operation
**Options:** Input that modifies the behavior of a command

## P
**Package:** A piece of software that can be combined with other packages to form an application
**Package manager:** A tool that helps users install, manage, and remove packages or applications
**Parrot:** An open-source distribution that is commonly used for security
**Penetration test (pen test):** A simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes. Penetration testing tools in KALI LINUX such as Metasploit can be used to look for and exploit vulnerabilities on machines, Burp Suite is another tool that helps to test for weaknesses in web applications and, John the Ripper is a tool used to guess passwords. 
**Peripheral devices:** Hardware components that are attached and controlled by the computer system
**Permissions:** The type of access granted for a file or directory
**Primary key:** A column where every row has a unique entry
**Principle of least privilege:** The concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task or function

## Q
**Query:** A request for data from a database table or a combination of tables

## R
**Random Access Memory (RAM):** A hardware component used for short-term memory
**Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® (also referred to simply as Red Hat in this course):** A subscription-based distribution of Linux built for enterprise use
**Relational database:** A structured database containing tables that are related to each
**other
**Relative file path:** A file path that starts from the user's current directory
**Root directory:** The highest-level directory in Linux
**Root user (or superuser):** A user with elevated privileges to modify the system

## S
**Shell:** The command-line interpreter. It processes commands and outputs the results.
**SQL (Structured Query Language):** A programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database
**Standard error:** An error message returned by the OS through the shell
**Standard input:** Information received by the OS via the command line
**Standard output:** Information returned by the OS through the shell
**String data:** Data consisting of an ordered sequence of characters
**Syntax:** The rules that determine what is correctly structured in a computing language

## U
**Ubuntu:** An open-source, user-friendly distribution that is widely used in security and other industries
**Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI):** A microchip that contains loading instructions for the computer and replaces BIOS on more modern systems
**User:** The person interacting with a computer
**User interface:** A program that allows the user to control the functions of the operating system

## W
**Wildcard:** A special character that can be substituted with any other character
