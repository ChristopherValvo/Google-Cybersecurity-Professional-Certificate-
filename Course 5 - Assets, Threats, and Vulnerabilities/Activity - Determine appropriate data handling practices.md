# Activity Overview

In this activity, you will review the results of a data risk assessment. You will determine whether effective data handling processes are being implemented to protect information privacy.

Data is among the most valuable assets in the world today. Everything from intellectual property to guest WiFi networks should be protected with a combination of technical, operational, and managerial controls. Implementing the principle of least privilege is essential to protect information privacy.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You work for an educational technology company that developed an application to help teachers automatically grade assignments. The application handles a wide range of data that it collects from academic institutions, instructors, parents, and students.

Your team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. An investigation by the team discovered that an employee accidentally shared those confidential documents with a customer. An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided.

A supervisor provided you with information regarding the leak. It appears that the principle of least privilege was not observed by employees at the company during a sales meeting. You have been asked to analyze the situation and find ways to prevent it from happening again.

First, you'll need to evaluate details about the incident. Then, you'll review the controls in place to prevent data leaks. Next, you'll identify ways to improve information privacy at the company. Finally, you'll justify why you think your recommendations will make data handling at the company more secure.

### Step 2: Analyze the situation

The principle of least privilege is a fundamental security control that helps maintain information privacy. However, least privilege starts to lose its effectiveness when too many users are given access to information. Data leaks commonly happen as information gets passed between people without oversight.

To start your analysis, review the following incident summary provided by your supervisor:

A customer success representative received access to a folder of internal documents from a manager. It contained files associated with a new product offering, including customer analytics and marketing materials. The manager forgot to unshare the folder. Later, the representative copied a link to the marketing materials to share with a customer during a sales call. Instead, the representative shared a link to the entire folder. During the sales call, the customer received the link to internal documents and posted it to their social media page.

After reviewing the summary, write 20-60 words (2-3 sentences) in the Issue(s) row of the Data leak worksheet describing the factors that led to the data leak.  

### Step 3: Review current data privacy controls 

Data leaks are a major risk due to the amount of data handled by the application. The company used the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to develop their plan for addressing their information privacy concerns.

Review the Security plan snapshot resource of the worksheet. Then, review the NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 resource of the worksheet.

After, write 20-60 words (2-3 sentences) in the Review row of the Data leak worksheet to summarize what you've learned about NIST SP 800-53: AC-6.

### Step 4: Identify control enhancements 

The company's implementation of least privilege is based on NIST Special Publication 800-53 (SP 800-53). NIST developed SP 800-53 to provide businesses with a customizable information privacy plan. It's a comprehensive resource that describes a wide range of control categories, including least privilege.

Use the NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 resource to determine two control enhancements that might have prevented the data leak. List the two improvements in the Recommendation(s) row of the worksheet.

### Step 5: Justify your reccomendations

At the end of your analysis, it's time to communicate your findings to your supervisor. It's important to justify your recommendations so that the supervisor can relay this information to other decision makers at the company.

Consider the issues you identified earlier. Then, write 20-60 words (2-3 sentences) in the Justification row describing why you think the control enhancements you recommend will reduce the likelihood of another data leak.

### Pro Tip: Save the template
Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your professional projects. These templates will help you work through your thought processes and demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

## What to Include in Your Response

Be sure to address the following elements in your completed activity: 

- 2-3 sentences analyzing the factors that led to the incident

- 2-3 sentences summarizing NIST SP 800-53: AC-6

- 2 control enhancement recommendations to improve least privilege 

- 2-3 sentences justifying your recommendations

## Assessment of Exemplar

Compare the exemplar to your completed activity. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

Note: The exemplar represents one possible way to complete the activity. Yours will likely differ in certain ways. Whatâ€™s important is that your activity reflects your analysis of appropriate data handling practices.


Next, review the details of the completed data leak worksheet:

### Issues
Many people neglected to keep the confidential information private. The manager should have done a better job keeping track of the internal folder by limiting access to the representative and themselves. The customer also could have done a better job of communicating their plans to share the marketing information before posting it to social media.

### Review
NIST SP 800-53 is a resource that's designed to help organizations address data privacy risks. The document defines security controls, describes implementation strategies, and suggests individual control enhancements. AC-6 is a section about access controls that relate to the principle of least privilege.

### Recommendation(s)
Based on the suggestion of NIST SP 800-53: AC-6, the data leak might have been avoided with the following controls:

- Automatically revoke access to information after a period of time.

- Regularly audit user privileges.

### Justification
Automating security tasks whenever possible is a good way to reduce the chances of human error. In this case, creating a policy that sets expiration dates for access links might have avoided the leak. Requiring managers to regularly audit who can access their files is another way that information could be kept private.
